hiddenfiles
=======
### overview
It's nothing crazy, but it will allow you to do this on the command line...
```shell
hiddenfiles show
```

And this...
```shell
hiddenfiles hide
```

It'll also respond to "true", "yes", "false", and "no". I hate having to look up the full command. because I'm #laz

### to install
run these on the commands in a terminal...
```shell
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dennisporterjr/hiddenfiles.git && cd hiddenfiles

# move to your local bin folder (you may or may not need to use "sudo")
sudo mv hiddenfiles /usr/local/bin/hiddenfiles && cd /usr/local/bin/

# make it executable..
sudo chmod 755 hiddenfiles
```
have fun not googling for this crap again lol :-)
